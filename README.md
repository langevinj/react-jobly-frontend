This application acts as the frontend for my Jobly API, a user logs into their account, or signups for an account to gain access to numerous functions. A user can search for companies or jobs by typing into the live-updating search bars, or can scroll through listings, which paginate pages for ease of use. A user may apply or unapply for jobs as they see fit, and these applications persist when logging in or out. A user may also edit parts of their own information from their Profile page.
